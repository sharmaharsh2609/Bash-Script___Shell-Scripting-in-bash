#The shebang (#!) is used because it will instruct the operating system that what comes next will be the interpreter of the script which in this case is /bin/bash.

#shell enables us to store any value in a variable
var1="Harsh"
var2=100
var-3=200	#It will give error as - is a special symbol and can't be used in variable name
echo $var1 $var2

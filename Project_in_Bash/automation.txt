#### Automating some tasks using bash

- When we have something like: we have to goto a certain path all the times and then open virtual environment
   and then come back to another path. We have to do a lot of steps everytime we open our system.
- For this, we can create a bash  file which automates all these tasks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- For this, we have to create a bash file and write the following commands
	cd dir1/dir2/dir3/
	source venv/bin/activate
	cd /home/user/dir1/dir2/
	jupyter notebook

- This is an example of automation of activating virtual environment ehich is present in some folder
  and then opening a jupyter notebook.

############## How does a bash file execute ?

- Generally, when we execute a bash file, it opens a new shell and executes all the commands inside that shell. 
  And close that newly opened shell after the completion of execution.
- So, if we write command:   "cd dir/dir2/.."
  If we store this command in a bash file and execute that file, then executing a bash file opens a new bash shell
  and on executing this command there, it changes the path in that newly opened shell. And when execution is complete,
  it destroys that shell. But there is no change made in our original terminal shell

############### Command to make our commands in a bash file affect in the current terminal:
- When we execute our bash file using './file.sh' command then a new shell is opened
- There are 2 other commands which are also used to execute a bash file also. But they execute bash file in same shell instead of creating a new shell for execution:
	source harsh.sh
		(OR)
	. harsh.sh

- source command and dot(.) command execute the bash file in same terminal. However they execute these files in different ways.

- So we can automate any bash commands or opening firefox etc.. and then execute that file by using source or .command
- This is the reason we activate any virtual environment by using command 'source venv/bin/activate'.
  This command executes this activate file in same shell. This activate is a bash file which on execution makes changes in current terminal to open virtualenv.

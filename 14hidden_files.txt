### Creating hidden files
- A hidden file is a file whose name start from .
- We can create hidden files like this:              touch ./file

### Converting a normal file to hidden file.
- We can hide a "file" already present by changing it's name to . at beginning like this:
	mv <file_name> .<file_name>
	eg- mv harsh.sh .harsh.sh

### To see the hidden file, we can use this command:
	ls -a

### To see the permissions of these hidden files, we can use this command:
	ls -al



#######   To execute hidden files.
- Hidden files are generally excluded from the global expansion of bash shell.However you can alter that using the dotglob setting 

- Hidden files can be visible to bash shell by changing the settings of doglob(read as do glob)
	shopt -s dotglob

- Now we can execute or do any command on the hidden files also and they are also visible on pressing tab.
	echo .harsh.sh		# this will show the content of the hidden file .harsh.sh
	./.harhs.sh		# this will execute the hidden file .harsh.sh
	. .harsh.sh (or) source .harsh.sh    # this will execute the .harsh.sh file in same shell instead of opening a new shell


- WE can always undo this above setting using command:
	shopt -u doglob      # -s flag is to set the value abd -u flag is to unset the value

#As explained in lvl14-->15 password of every level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit(0..35)  But it can only be accessed by the same user. for eg- password of lvl14 can only be seen by user bandit14 


Level0:  ssh -port 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org	# passwords are stored in a file named password	

Level0->1:	cat readme	#passwd is stored in this file 
Level1->2:	cat ./-		or	cat <full path of - >	#path of - file can be seen from pwd command. also - file can't be accessed directly using cat - as - is a special keyword used for stdin and stdout
Level2->3:	cat 'spaces in this filename'	or	cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename		#spaces acts as seperators. so we need to use backslash before every space in order to access space not as a keyword or we can write the whole file name in a quotes
Level3->4:	cd inhere
		ls -a
		cat .hidden
Level4->5:	cd inhere
		for x in {0..9}; do file ./-file0$x; done
		 cat ./-file07
Level5->6:	cd inhere
		find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable #output: ./maybehere07/.file2
		cat <address in output of previous command> ie.- cat ./maybehere07/.file2
Level6->7:	find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null		# here because we do not have access to all the permissions, so this command will show a lot of errors also for permission denied and it will be difficult to search file in such messed up output. To resolve this issue, we use 2>/dev/null which redirects stderr(1 for stdout,2 for stderr, 3 for stdin) to file /dev/null. and /dev/null is a file which throws away amy input that you give it as input.
		<copy the output address and paste in cat command>
		cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
Level7->8:	cat data.txt | grep millionth
Level8->9:	cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u	or	sort data.txt |uniq -u
Level9->10:	
Level10->11:	
Level11->12:	cat data.txt | tr [a-z] [n-za-m] | tr [A-Z] [N-ZA-M]		#tr or translate command is used for translating a range of characters or squeezing similar characters and of many more use.
	or	cat data.txt | tr [a-zA-Z] [n-za-mN-ZA-M]	
Level12->13:	
Level13->14:	ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost	#Here -i is used as these are on same server.. Note here we are connecting to bandit14 user on host_name: localhost and not on bandit.overthewire... Synatax of conneting to user on same device: ssh -i <private_key_name> <username@hostname>
		#Now we're connected to bandit14 
		cd /etc/bandit_pass
		cat bandit14

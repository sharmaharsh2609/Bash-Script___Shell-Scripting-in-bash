As a space acts as a delimiter(seperator), we can't access files with soaces directly. That would take only first word of file as name.
eg.- nano My File		This will search for file with name My as space acts as a seperator 

To access files with spaces :
1. we need to use backslash before every space as space is a special character. 
   eg.- nano My\ File

2. or the easiest method is to write the file name in commas
   eg.- nano 'My File' 




Note:   In bash scripting, to access any special character we need to use \ .
	In bash scripting, if we get any error in the path of some command then check for the special characters and put a backslash before all the special characters.

	eg.- while using some URL we may encounter & in the path of URL. So it will not open the correct Url, instead it will open the incomplete Url.
        This happens becoz bash takes URL before '&' only as & is a special character. We need to use a backslash before every & to make it work properly

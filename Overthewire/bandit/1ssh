SSH- Secure Shell

ssh command is used to connect to a remote server
ssh is a very secure way of connecting to a remote server as it uses different encrypting techniques which can't be easily decrypted(by attackers).
syntax: ssh <username>@<hostname>		or     ssh <hostname>    if username of host is same as the username of client. [Note here host is the system which we are trying to connect remotely and client is the system which is trying to connect to the host]
eg.-  ssh Harsh@10.0.2.15	where Harsh is username and 10.2.0.15 is IP address of host. We can provide IP address or domain name of the remote server as host

-  by default ssh uses port number 22. But in some servers port number is not 22 and we neesd to define port number using flag -p <port_no>
eg. ssh -p 2220 Harsh@10.0.2.15		

example of domain name as host:  ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Here in above example, bandit0 is the username and bandit.labs.overthewire.org is the domain name of the server. So here we use domain name as host

- One very imp point is that while using ssh, the remote server and the client server should be turned on and both should be cconnected to the internet.
 This is the reason we cannot connect to the user stored in the same system becuase it is not turned on at the same time
